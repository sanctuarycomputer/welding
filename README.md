## Intro

Welding is a decentralized knowledge graph protocol for building and managing networks of research and documentation. It is inspired by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Are.na](https://www.are.na/) & [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/); but it is built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (and deployed to [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)), allowing every `Subgraph`, `Topic` & `Document` to be backed by an NFT, ensuring all content is free and public forever (via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)).

Through a novel ERC721 contract design, NFTs can cross-reference each other by merging “edges” into the graph. Researchers and writers can earn royalties as their writing is referenced (and backlinked) by others, allowing all humans to participate and be rewarded for contributing their thought, ideas, and knowledge as they learn together, in the open.

## Documentation

Welding is documented with Welding → [welding.app](https://www.welding.app).

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Subsitute the `{Add me...` env vars in `.env` with your own
4. `yarn install`
5. `yarn dev`
