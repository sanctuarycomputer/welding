            There was only one problem. What was now identified as the most
            valuable aspect of a commodity was also – technically, at least –
            capable of infinite replication at near zero cost: once the cost of
            creating a new set of instructions has been incurred the
            instructions can be used over and over again at no additional cost.
            Developing new and better instructions is equivalent to incurring a
            fixed cost.’ Romer made no mention of the hacker movement, but this
            was starting to sound remarkably similar to Stewart Brand’s
            conclusion that ‘information wants to be free’ some six years
            earlier.

            This contradiction was particularly portentous for market
            capitalism. As Larry Summers and J. Bradford DeLong would write in
            August 2001, just a month after the file-sharing service Napster was
            taken down, ‘the most basic condition for economic efficiency … [is]
            that price equal marginal cost.’ They went on: ‘with information
            goods, the social and marginal cost of distribution is close to
            zero.’ This held true not only for films, music, books and academic
            papers but also for the design of an industrial robot or
            pharmaceutical drug.
